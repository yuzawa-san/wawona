Easily make office reservations in sequoia from the command line.
This tool is provides streamlined workflows:

- viewing the next two week's bookings from coworkers that you have followed (in the app/[site](https://px.sequoia.com/workplace))
- booking multiple days at a time
- doing space reservations (with the ability to save your preferred space)
- if an option contains a single choice, automatically select that choice

## Install

The easiest way is probably using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
A self-maintained tap is available for use. To install tap:
```console
brew tap yuzawa-san/tap
```

To install:
```console
brew update
brew install wawona
```

To update:
```console
brew update
# upgrade all Homebrew software
brew upgrade
# update just this
brew upgrade wawona
```

## Usage 

- Run it from your terminal: `wawona`
- On initial run, you will be asked to provide configuration details and to do an initial login.
- Login uses a standalone chrome powered by selenium.
- Periodically, you will be asked to re-login.
- Use the up/down arrows, spacebar, and return keys to select items in lists
- Troubleshooting errors with `wawona --verbose`

### Reset

If you need to reset to factory defaults (maybe if you changed your password), remove the configuration:

```console
wawona reset
```

As a last resort, if all else fails:

```console
rm -rf ~/.config/wawona/
```

## Notes

- Not affliated with sequoia
- Uses public endpoints discovered from the web UI
- No warranty or stability guarantees, could break one day if something changes on their end
- Password/token is stored in system keychain
- Add/remove followers using the app.
- Basically if it is not here or it breaks here, use the real app/site.
- Named for the [drive-thru sequoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawona_Tree)
