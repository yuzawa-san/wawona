## Install

The easiest way is probably using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
A self-maintained tap is available for use. To install tap:
```console
brew tap yuzawa-san/tap
```

To install:
```console
brew update
brew install wawona
```

To update:
```console
brew update
# upgrade all Homebrew software
brew upgrade
# update just this
brew upgrade wawona
```

## Usage 

- Run it from your terminal: `wawona`
- On initial run, you will be asked provide configuration: email and password.
- You may be prompted to for an MFA token periodically.

### Reset

If you need to reset to factory defaults (maybe if you changed your password), remove the configuration:

```console
rm -rf ~/.config/wawona/
```

## Notes

- Not affliated with sequoia
- Uses public endpoints discovered from the web UI
- No warranty or stability guarantees, could break one day if something changes on their end
- Password/token is stored in system keychain
- Add/remove followers using the app. basically if it is not here or it breaks here, use the real app/site.
- Named for the [drive-thru sequoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawona_Tree)
